 *                             
 * The File class is Javaâ€™s representation of a file or directory pathname. Because file and directory names 
 * have different formats on different platforms, a simple string is not adequate to name them. 
 * The File class contains several methods for working with the pathname, deleting and renaming files, 
 * creating new directories, listing the contents of a directory, and determining several common attributes
 *  of files  and directories.
